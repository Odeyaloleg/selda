## Chapter 1: An Example, Explained

To start learning the basics of Selda, let's dissect the example from
the front page of the website, and use it to illustrate the core concepts
of the Selda library.

After reading this chapter, you will be able to define and create tables,
insert new rows, and perform simple queries against those tables.

```language-haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric, OverloadedStrings, OverloadedLabels #-}
import Database.Selda
import Database.Selda.SQLite
```

We start off by declaring the language extensions we'll need to use, and
importing the core Selda library and the SQLite backend.
`Database.Selda` houses the Selda DSL itself, whereas
`Database.Selda.SQLite` allows us to run Selda programs over SQLite databases.

The `DeriveGeneric` extension lets us derive the `Generic` type class, which
is important since Selda uses generics heavily to map Haskell types to database
tables. `OverloadedStrings` is not strictly required, but highly recommended
to reduce boilerplate when working with `Text` fields.
`OverloadedLabels` is used to specify *field selectors*, which
will be explained in greater detail [a few paragraphs down](tutorial/ch1-example-explained#selectors).

```language-haskell
data Pet = Dog | Horse | Dragon
  deriving (Show, Read, Bounded, Enum)
instance SqlType Pet
```

Here, we declare a `Pet` *enumeration type*, to represent the various types
of pets one might have. Selda is able to map enumeration types &mdash; any type
implementing `Enum` and `Bounded` &mdash; if we just add an `SqlType` instance
for it. In this case, we also derive `Show` and `Read` which automatically
gives us the appropriate conversions between our `Pet` type and its database
representation.

The `SqlType` type class denotes types which are representable as a single
database column. These types include various numeric types, `Text`,
date and time types, etc.

```language-haskell
data Person = Person
  { name :: Text
  , age :: Int
  , pet :: Maybe Pet
  } deriving Generic
instance SqlRow Person
```

Now it's time to create a data type to describe our table.
Any product type &mdash; a type with a single data constructor &mdash; where all fields
are instances of `SqlType` can be used for tables and as results from queries
if they implement the `SqlRow` type class.
By deriving `Generic` for our type, we can use the default `SqlRow` instance.
In fact, you should never need to implement `SqlRow` yourself.

<a id="selectors"></a>

```language-haskell
people :: Table Person
people = table "people" [#name :- primary]
```

Once we have the `Person` type and its `SqlRow` instance, building a table
from it is easy.
The `table` function accepts a table name, and a list of column attributes where
things like indexes, foreign keys and other constraints can be declared.
Such attributes are specified by linking *selectors* of the table
&mdash; such as `#name` in this example &mdash; to various attribute
definitions.
In our example, we want to specify the `name` field as the primary key of our
table.

Field selectors work by passing the *name* of a plain Haskell record selector,
using the `OverloadedLabels` extension, to the `field` function *as a type*,
which then performs some type-level magic to
ensure that the selector is valid for the row we want to use it on.
If this makes your head spin, don't worry; the only thing you need to remember
about field selectors is `#-sign + record selector = field selector`.

There also exists a handy function `selectors`, which generates
all selectors for some table in one go.
In fact, since the `#...` syntax requires the presence of an actual
record selector, using `selectors` is the *only* way to define selectors for
non-record types, such as `(Int, Int)` or `data Foo = Foo Text Bool Double`.


```language-haskell
main = withSQLite "people.sqlite" $ do
  ...
```

To run a Selda program, we need to specify a database to run it over.
In our example, we use the SQLite database and specify `people.sqlite` as the
file in which our database will be stored.

Selda computations are written in some monad which implements the
`MonadSelda` type class. For most Selda programs &mdash; including our example &mdash; the
built-in `SeldaM` monad is just fine.
Unless you really want to, you'll never need to bother with implementing
a Selda monad of your own.

```language-haskell
createTable people
insert_ people
  [ Person "Velvet"    19 (Just Dog)
  , Person "Kobayashi" 23 (Just Dragon)
  , Person "Miyu"      10 Nothing
  ]
```

Before we can store any data in a table, we need to create it.
The `createTable` function will attempt to create its given table, and throw
a `SeldaError` if the table already exists.

Once we've created our table, we use `insert_` to insert three rows into
our newly created table. Each row is represented by a plain Haskell value of
the table's type.

```language-haskell
adultsAndTheirPets <- query $ do
  ...
```

The main meat of the Selda library is, of course, queries.
Within a Selda computation the database can be queried using the `query`
function, which takes a query computation as its input.

Queries are written in the `Query` monad, which is parameterised over a
*scope parameter* `s`.
This parameter ensures that queries are always well-scoped (i.e. do not access
columns which are not in scope).
While this parameter makes type errors more complicated, it is a necessary evil
as it lets us reconcile the differences in scoping between SQL and Haskell
in a safe and (more or less) elegant way.


```language-haskell
person <- select people
```

The `select` function is used to draw data rows from a table.
In this example `person` has the type `Row s Person`, and represents a single
row from the `people` table.

```language-haskell
restrict (person ! field @"age" .>= 18)
```

The columns of a row can be accessed using the table's selectors.
The syntax for this is `row ! selector`. The column thus obtained can then be
arbitrarily used in expressions.

In this example, we use the `restrict` function (roughly equivalent
to SQL `WHERE`) to filter out all persons who have an `age` lower than 18.

```language-haskell
return (person ! field @"name" :*: person ! field @"pet")
```

Once we're done fetching rows and filtering, we can return any number of rows
or columns, grouped together as an *inductive tuple* &mdash;
one or more values separated by the `:*:` data constructor.

Whatever we return from a query will, upon execution, be converted to
the corresponding Haskell type and returned from the `query` call we just
returned from.

The rows from a query are returned as a list, which each element corresponding
to a single result row. For instance, a query of type `Query s (Row s Person)`
will return `[Person]` when executed, and a query of
type `Query s (Row s Person :*: Col s Int)` will return `[Person :*: Int]`.

In this particular example, the `name` field of the person table has type
`Text` and the `pet` field has type `Maybe Text`.
From this we can deduce that the query has type
`Query s (Col s Text :*: Col s (Maybe Text))`, meaning that the type returned
back to Haskell land will be `[Text :*: Maybe Text]`.

```language-haskell
liftIO $ print adultsAndTheirPets
```

To verify that this whole example works as advertised, we print out the entire
result set of the query.
As `SeldaM` implements `MonadIO` we can just lift the standard `print` function
into the computation.

Since Miyu is the only person in the table who is under the age of 18,
the result set, when printed, should look like this:

```language-haskell
["Velvet" :*: Just Dog,"Kobayashi" :*: Just Dragon]
```
